Have a poisoned Limited and Dont want to get banned?

Well, I will be telling you How to Clean Limiteds!
Also, If your Limited Has NO Serial Number, Its good and you dont have to clean it.

To clean a Poisoned limited, You want to Flip it at https://rbxflip.com or you can Trade it for the same Item.

Another way is you can USD Sell it or If you want to keep the Poisoned Limited, You can have 2 or more alt account with premium and just trade it constantly from One account to the other. In the meantime it should Just Become Unpoisoned.

If you receive a poisoned limited, You have at least 1 week or 24 hours to get rid of it Or there is a Very high change of you get terminated for "Account Theft".


So good luck cleaning Limiteds I guess!
