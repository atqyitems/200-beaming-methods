Fixed API method (a;#6666 method)

1. You find someone, in trade hangout or something and add them on discord. After doing that you send them a trade (for example, all their items for you small). 

2. Head to https://trades.roblox.com/v1/trades/Outbound?sortOrder=Asc&limit=100 and get the outbound trade ID.

3. Tell the user you sent the trade, to go to https://trades.roblox.com/docs#!/Trades/post_v1_trades_tradeId_accept and paste the outbound trade ID from step 2,  in "trade ID" on the second link. This will make the user auto accept the trade
