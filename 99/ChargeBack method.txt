First of all you've gotta purchase a set ROBUX or Premium on the site ON AN ALTERNATIVE ACCOUNT via a PayPal account that you have access to.

After that you've gotta USD sell the ROBUX or transfer the ROBUX to a group that one of your other groups own

After this you've got to head to the ROBUX transaction on PayPal, scroll to the bottom and press Report a problem, after pressing that, click I didn't receive an item I purchased and type in the description "I did not get the ROBUX that I purchased.

Within 2 days ROBLOX support should fully refund you the money that you spent on the ROBUX, allowing you to keep the ROBUX that you put on the group or sold for USD.
