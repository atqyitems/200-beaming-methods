1. You find someone, in trade hangout or something and add them on discord. After doing that you send them a trade (for example, all their items for you small).\
2. Head to https://trades.roblox.com/v1/trades/Outb...&limit=100 and get the outbound trade ID.
3. Tell the user you sent the trade, to go to https://trades.roblox.com/docs#!/Trades/...eId_accept and paste the outbound trade ID from step 2,  in "trade ID" on the second link. This will make the user auto accept the trade

SECOND METHOD

1. First you want to find a victim and try to get close and pretend you want to help them ( or any other way ).. After finding this person.. you want to send them a scam trade aka their bigs for your small.

2. After sending that trade you want to head over to https://trades.roblox.com/v1/trades/Outbound?sortOrder=Asc&limit=100 to get the id for the scam trade. ( the first set of numbers )

3. Then you have to convince the victim to head over to https://trades.roblox.com/docs#!/Trades/get_v1_trades_tradeId and tell them to paste the set of numbers into trade id - required and click try out!.

4. When the victim clicks try out, it auto accepts the scam trade. Enjoy!
